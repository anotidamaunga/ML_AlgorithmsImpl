#this is going to be an implementation of k-Nearest neighbour
#this is a lazy algorithm that stores the data and only trains when query is passed
#it checks the nearest neighbours of a new data point using the distance to determine points to take
#yes for now I have just gone through the tutorial from tutorials point but I intend on finding my own dataset and try it from scratch
#can be used for both classification and regression
